### [Assignment Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFLQs7Lepb8hcYOrZq5scmRmdcNkIwWZ6Kb85_0bCVY/edit?usp=sharing)

***
Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
This program is a simulated fight game using pygame. Enemies move randomly and when they come in contact with the hero, the hero loses health. If enough health is lost, the player loses. If the hero survives, the player wins.

#### Unique Feature
I unsuccessfully attempted to add a play again feature. I was able to successfully add and move the text, but my key.event features were not effective.
